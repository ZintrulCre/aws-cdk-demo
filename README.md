# AWS CDK Demo

## Project Structure

- *lib/\*.ts*: CDK application’s main stack definition.
- *bin/cdk-workshop.ts*: the entrypoint of the CDK application.
- *cdk.json*: tells the toolkit how to run your app. In our case it will be "npx ts-node bin/cdk-workshop.ts"
- *tsconfig.json*: the project’s typescript configuration
- *package.json*: npm module manifest. It includes information like the name of the app, version, dependencies and build scripts like “watch” and “build”
- *package-lock.json*: generated by npm. It describes the exact tree that was generated to allow subsequent installs to have the identical tree.
- *node_modules*: maintained by npm. It includes all the project’s dependencies.
